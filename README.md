# Pok√©dex App

An educational and engaging Pok√©dex app built with **Jetpack Compose**, designed to be intuitive and fun for both kids and adults. The app showcases Pok√©mon data in a colorful, searchable interface with lightweight performance and smooth user experience.

## üß† Overview

This project leverages:

- Modern **Jetpack Compose** for UI
- **Kotlin** and **Coroutines** for asynchronous logic
- **MVVM architecture** using ViewModels for state management
- **Hilt** for dependency injection and testability
- **DataStore** for persistent state (e.g., "My Pok√©mon")
- **PokeKotlin** client library for API integration
- **Coil** for image loading
- In-memory caching and a clean separation of concerns for performance

## ‚ú® Features

- üé≤ **Featured Screen**: Discover a random Pok√©mon on app launch, complete with flavor text and catch button.
- üåü **Shiny Mode**: Catch shiny Pok√©mon based on probability and toggle shiny state using persistent storage.
- üìö **Pok√©dex**: Browse and search all Pok√©mon using fuzzy matching.
- ‚ù§Ô∏è **My Pok√©mon**: View your favorite caught Pok√©mon in a simple 2-column layout.
- üîç **Detail View**: Get detailed info for each Pok√©mon including types and description.

## üß± Architecture

The app is structured using **MVVM** with clearly separated responsibilities:

- **Model**: Represents Pok√©mon data and API responses
- **ViewModel**: Handles logic, caching, and state production for UI
- **View (Compose)**: Reactively consumes state from ViewModel

**Hilt** provides dependency injection throughout the app, allowing services and repositories to be easily injected and mocked during testing.

## üèÉ Getting Started

### Requirements

- Android Studio Giraffe or newer
- JDK 11
- Minimum SDK 24
- Target SDK 35

### Run Instructions

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in Android Studio
3. Run the `:app` module on an emulator or physical device

Data is loaded on first app launch using `PokemonService.preloadModelsWithProgress()`, then cached in-memory for fast retrieval.

To reduce memory usage, flavor text is no longer preloaded. It is fetched dynamically when needed.

## üß™ Testing

This project uses a combination of **unit tests** (`test/`) and **UI/functional tests** (`androidTest/`):

- `test/` contains fast, isolated unit tests for repository and service logic (e.g., validating Pok√©mon data loading and formatting).
- `androidTest/` includes instrumented Compose UI tests that verify screen behavior and navigation (e.g., switching tabs, showing Pok√©mon details).

All tests can be run directly from Android Studio or via Gradle using:

```bash
./gradlew test                   # Runs unit tests
./gradlew connectedAndroidTest  # Runs instrumented UI tests
```
